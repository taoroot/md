# nignx

## Mac Brew 

The default port has been set in /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf to 8080 so that
nginx can run without sudo.

nginx will load all files in /usr/local/etc/nginx/servers/.

To have launchd start nginx now and restart at login:
  brew services start nginx
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  nginx

sudo nginx #启动nginx服务
sudo nginx -s reload #重启nginx服务
配置文件路径/usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
安装之后默认的端口是8080
